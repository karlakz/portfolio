3. [DOM Crash Course 2020 - How Does JavaScript DOM Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wvi4Srvggg&t=858s)
   What I learned:
   - Browser's engine is able to read html, css and js files;
   - If an error occurs with HTML code, the browser tries to handle it and there is no way of showing the error on the browser;
   - If an arror occurs with CSS or JS code, then JS will let the developer know about it;
   - There is a special variable called `window`, which is injected by the browser into the JS world. This `window` acts as a bridge for JS to communicate with a lot of DOM APIs.
4. [JavaScript DOM Crash Course - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ik6X4DJKCc)\
   What I learned:
   - DOM is a structured representation of the HTML document. It is a tree of nodes created by the browser and JS can be used to manipulate the DOM and its elements;
   - DOM is object-oriented meaning that each node has its own properties and methods;
5. [JavaScript DOM Crash Course - Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPd2aJXCZ2g)\
   What I learned:
   - `parentNode` and `parentElement` are used interchangeably;
   - `childNode` is not recommended to use as it takes into account all the line breaks, instead `children` is preferred.
   - Similarly, `firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, previousSibling` also return line-breaks, while `firstElementChild, lastElementChild, nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling` point to the elements;
   - We can create HTML elements from inside JS, add classess, ids, attributes, textNodes to it and insert all of them into the DOM using `insertBefore(), insertAfter()` methods;
