3. [DOM Crash Course 2020 - How Does JavaScript DOM Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wvi4Srvggg&t=858s)
   What I learned:
   - Browser's engine is able to read html, css and js files;
   - If an error occurs with HTML code, the browser tries to handle it and there is no way of showing the error on the browser;
   - If an arror occurs with CSS or JS code, then JS will let the developer know about it;
   - There is a special variable called `window`, which is injected by the browser into the JS world. This `window` acts as a bridge for JS to communicate with a lot of DOM APIs.
